The affected area might be: Warm to the touch?? Full of pus or other drainage?? Accompanied by a fever. These can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses that require surgical draining. Sometimes the bacteria remain confined to the skin.

In some cases, antibiotics may not be necessary. For example, doctors may drain a superficial abscess caused by MRSA rather than treat the infection with drugs.','Wash your hands after touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items, whether or not gloves are worn. You may also need to perform hand hygiene between tasks and procedures on the same patient to prevent cross-contamination of different body sites. Wear gloves, a gown, and mouth/nose/eye protection when you will come in contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, nonintact skin, or potentially contaminated intact skin (e.g., of a patient incontinent of stool or urine). Learn more about glove use.

Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include: Chest pain when you breathe or cough; Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older); Cough, which may produce phlegm; Fatigue; Fever, sweating and shaking chills; Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems); Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea; Shortness of breath.','Fast-acting medications includes: salbutamol (albuterol USAN); ipratropium bromide; epinephrine. Long_term control includes: Corticosteroids;  salmeterol and formoterol;  montelukast and zafirlukast, etc.','Treatment for pneumonia involves curing the infection and preventing complications. People who have community-acquired pneumonia usually can be treated at home with medication. Although most symptoms ease in a few days or weeks, the feeling of tiredness can persist for a month or more.','A vaccine is available against the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumoniae (also known as Pneumococcus). There are two types of vaccine: PPSV23 (Pneumovax), a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine against 23 types of the bacteria, and PCV13 (Prevnar 13), a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that protects against 13 types of the bacteria. These vaccines may not always prevent pneumococcal pneumonia, but they may prevent serious complications of pneumonia if it does occur. Avoidance of areas where fungal pathogens are endemic is recommended to prevent fungal pneumonias. There is no antifungal vaccine available; however, for some high-risk patients, some doctors have recommended prophylactic antifungal drugs.',1,'fever,dyspnea,rattle sound lungs');
